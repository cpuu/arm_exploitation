# Stack0
What you will learn
- How memory can be accessed outside of its allocated region
- How the stack variables are laid out
- How to modify program execution

Goal: Change the ‚Äòmodified‚Äô variable. You solved the challenge once ‚ÄúYou have changed the ‚Äòmodified‚Äô variable‚Äù is printed out.

# Stack1
What you will learn
- How to modify variables to specific values in the program
- How the variables are laid out in memory

Goal: Change the ‚Äòmodified‚Äô variable. You solved the challenge once ‚ÄúYou have changed the ‚Äòmodified‚Äô variable‚Äù is printed out.

# Stack2
What you will learn
- How environment variables can be set

Goal: modify the GREENIE variable

# Stack3
What you will learn
- Environment variables and how they can be set
- How to overwrite function pointers stored on the stack
- How to overwrite the saved PC

Goal: change the code flow by accessing the win() function

# Stack4
What you will learn
- How to overwrite PC
- Standard buffer overflows

Goal: change the code flow by making PC jump to the win() function.

# Stack5
What you will learn
- Standard buffer overlow
- How to use shellcode to take advantage of a buffer overflow

Goal: overwrite PC and make it branch to your shellcode.

Wouldn‚Äôt it be cool if you could use your own shellcode for this challenge? Hell yeah, you can learn how to write your own shellcode by following my tutorial on Writing ARM Shellcode. Try it out, it‚Äôs not that hard and it‚Äôs fun! üôÇ

# Stack6
What you will learn
- What happens when you have restrictions on the return address?
- ret2libc, or ROP

Goal: Get control over PC and execute your shellcode using techniques like ret2libc or ROP
